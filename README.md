# searchSpeakerDeck

Working prototype of a tool to search Speaker Deck for talks, sort them by date (in absence of a site-wide API) and return the HTML of the most recent talks with which to reconstruct a browser view (could also be rewritten to provide a simpler feed).

Pretty useless until Speaker Deck increase their pagination limit of 50 pages (interesting queries commonly >500 pages).
